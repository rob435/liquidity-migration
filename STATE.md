Current operational snapshot of the live trading fleet and host environment.

## 1. Live Deployment Snapshot

Verified against the running host on 2026-09-03 11:47 UTC:

| Property | Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Host** | `ip-208-84-103-4.my-advin.com` (`208.84.103.4`) | 4 vCPU, 8 GB RAM, 118 GB disk (36% used, 72 GB free). |
| **Deployed Commit** | `a2dc5a45` (`Fix the signal stream at its root, revive the instrument lane, page an agent on CRITICAL (#14)`) | Verified across both engines, workers, and git checkout. |
| **Rollback Target** | `af40545ea9ce3eb3ec52a49adfb7078c9f3a01f9` | Stored in `/opt/liquidity-migration-engine/previous-commit`. Rolling back re-opens the signal-stream fault fixed in `a2dc5a45`. |
| **Funded Status** | `real-money armed` | `REAL_MONEY=true`. The engine is running again after the 2026-09-03 nine-hour stop (CHANGELOG). The 24h loss window that was tripped on 09-02/03 clears itself 24h after the losing close; read `rolling_loss_tripped` in the heartbeat for the current answer. |
| **Signal IPC** | spool row + `stream.sock` doorbell | Every observation is a spool row first; the socket frame only saves the engine its next poll. Worker generations were renewed on both realms on 2026-09-03 after the desync; the old `g805c44f0…` (mainnet) and `gc4d0071f…` (demo) cursors stay in the WAL. |

## 2. Active Strategy Sleeves & Dials

| ID | Sleeve | Status | Rules & Dials | Execution Mandate |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0** | **CARRY** | Active | `configs/lane2_carry_hold_v7.json` | $3\times$ notional, $5\times$ leverage, $35\%$ stop. Entry $\le -10\text{ bp}$, exit $>-3\text{ bp}$. |
| **1** | **LONG** | Active | `configs/long_native_v12.json` | $6.0\times$ operational mult, top-10 volume rank, $15\%$ price velocity, $3\times\text{ATR}$ stop, $3\text{d}$ hold. |
| **2** | **EXODUS** | Active | `configs/lane2_exodus_short_v1.json`| Consumes CARRY pre-settlement event. Enters short; covers at $S+60\text{m}$. |
| **3** | **MAKER** | Disabled | `configs/lane2_toxic_flow_quoter_v1.json` | Microstructural market making on `AGIUSDT` (`quote_enabled = false`). |

### Shared Account Risk Dials (`configs/operational.json`)
* **Gross Exposure Ceiling**: $5.0\times$ equity.
* **Initial Margin Ceiling**: $1.0\times$ equity.
* **Capital Reference**: Floating equity (floored at $\$100$).
* **Rolling-Loss Circuit Breaker**: $0.10$ ($10\%$ of capital reference lost in 24h trips emergency entry halt). A trip survives a restart, is reported by `rolling_loss_tripped`, and shows every sleeve as `entries_enabled: false`.
