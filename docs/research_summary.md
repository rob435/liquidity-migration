# Research summary — liquidity-migration strategy

**Updated 2026-05-29.** Single consolidated research record (replaces the deleted Round 1 +
Round 2 per-phase docs; originals in git history). Methodology standard:
[backtesting_errors_we_never_repeat.md](backtesting_errors_we_never_repeat.md).

## The core distinction: SELECTION signal vs EXECUTION signal

The strategy has two separable layers, and conflating them caused the wrong Round-2
conclusions:

1. **Selection (initial signal) — *which* names are candidates.** A liquidity-migration
   event: a mid-liquidity perp (rank 31–400, top-30 excluded) takes in price-insensitive
   flow — turnover ≥6×, ≥150-place rank climb, modest residual return ≥8%, strong close,
   top-10% of events excluded. This identifies a *candidate pool*. It is **not** an entry.
2. **Execution (entry signal) — *when* to short.** The thesis is the in-migrated flow
   **exhausts and fades**. You do **not** short at the top (the pump can continue). You wait
   for the fade to **confirm**, then enter — "**fade the fade**." The deployed execution
   (`promoted_quality_squeeze`, volume_events.py:1003–1036) already does this: track the
   post-event high, require a **pop**, then enter the short on the **giveback** from that
   high. Selection ≠ execution.

**Why this matters / the bias we removed.** The momentum-continuation finding (the extreme
post-event names *continue up* +26/+39 bps before fading) is **not** evidence the strategy
fails — it is the **reason the execution signal must wait for confirmation**. Immediate
entry shorts into that continuation and gets run over; a fade-confirmation entry sidesteps
it. The old "fade-the-pump short thesis fails" root-cause was an artifact of testing
immediate entry.

## Current status (honest)

The earlier **"Round 2 = documented null"** was substantially wrong, for two compounding
reasons:
- **Methodology (pessimistic execution model):** worst-case `bar_extreme` stop fills +
  `max_active=3` over-concentration + a ×3 (45 bps) cost. Fixed: default is now
  `bar_extreme_capped` (10%), and the validated config is `max_active=12`.
- **Selection/execution conflation:** the continuous test (C2) used *immediate* entry, never
  the fade-confirmation execution.

Under the realistic fill + sane concentration, the **daily** strategy is **positive on
both venues in-sample.** It remains in-sample; the forward demo (since 2026-05-22) is the
arbiter; nothing is promoted.

## E1 (2026-05-30): the EXECUTION signal is NOT load-bearing — the alpha is SELECTION

The E1 experiment (+ the E1b knob-engagement robustness probe) tested the thesis directly: on the *same*
selection pool, costs, and concentration (full-PIT, capped10, max_active=12, 15 bps,
both venues, 2023-04→2026-05), vary only `--entry-policy`: A `fixed_delay` (immediate
+1h) vs B `promoted_quality_squeeze` (fade-confirmation).

| venue | A immediate (fixed_delay) | B fade-confirm (quality_squeeze) | premium B−A |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| bybit | **+67.3% / MAR 2.76 / Sh 1.07** | +71.2% / MAR 2.93 | +0.17 MAR (LOO-flips, recent-only) |
| binance | **+8.0% / MAR 0.28** (funding-missing) | +7.3% / MAR 0.25 | −0.03 MAR (sign-flip) |

**Verdict: SELECTION-DOMINANT.** The fade-confirmation execution adds nothing robust —
pooled MAR Δ ≈ +0.01 (Tier-2 `descriptive`), it sign-flips across venues, the bybit
premium is a fragile recent-month artifact (LOO flips the sign), and the high-power
paired micro-test on the genuinely time-divergent trades is pure noise (bybit t=+0.35,
binance t=−1.30). The E1b probe forced 6× more engagement (bybit giveback trades 69→267)
and the premium was unchanged → robust to engagement level. **The alpha is the SELECTION
pool + a plain +1h short.** Two reasons the execution layer is inert: (a) `promoted_quality_squeeze`
never *filters* the pool (A and B trade the identical candidates), and (b) at 1h granularity
most "givebacks" complete inside the entry bar, so the timing barely moves (only ~3–9% of
entries differ from immediate). **`promoted_quality_squeeze` ≈ immediate entry in practice.**

**What this corrects:** the 2026-05-29 retraction was right that the old null was a
worst-case-fills + over-concentration artifact (E1 confirms the strategy is strongly
positive — bybit +67% at honest 15 bps). But its framing that the strategy is a SELECTION
*and* an EXECUTION (fade-confirmation) signal — and that execution is the open lead — is
**not supported**. Execution timing is a non-lever at 1h; E3 (sniper) is therefore not
justified (its gate fails). **The open lead is SELECTION refinement.**

## Daily strategy — realistic re-baseline (full-PIT, `bar_extreme_capped` 10%, in-sample 2023-04→2026-05)

| config | venue | stop fill | cost | total ret | max DD | worst day | Sharpe |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| baseline, max_active=3 (DEPLOYED) | bybit | `bar_extreme` | 45bps | −32% | −87% | −36% | 0.19 |
| baseline, **max_active=12** | bybit | **capped 10%** | 45bps | **+37.8%** | −27.5% | −4.8% | **0.70** |
| baseline, **max_active=12** | binance | **capped 10%** | 45bps | −4.7% (**gross +16.1%**) | −33.6% | −4.4% | −0.05 |

All rows use the `promoted_quality_squeeze` (fade-confirmation) execution. At the honest
15 bps cost the drag roughly thirds → bybit higher, **binance ~breakeven-to-positive**.
**Both venues are gross-positive.** The top row is the old worst-case (what the "null" was
built on). *(Binance funding is **missing** in these runs — `binance_full_pit` has no funding
dataset wired; label `funding-missing`. Correcting an earlier note: this does NOT understate
binance — E1 shows bybit short funding is a net **−6.2% drag** (modeled), not a credit, so
adding funding would if anything pull binance **down**. The cross-venue gap is real, not a
funding artifact.)*

## The open lead (post-E1): SELECTION refinement, not execution

E1 closed the execution question (above): timing is a non-lever, so E2/E3 pivot away
from execution. (The E1→E2→E3 plan ran its course — E1 triggered the contingency: E2 became a **selection
refinement** study and E3/sniper was dropped. The forward plan is now
[research_plan_intraday_kernel.md](research_plan_intraday_kernel.md).)

Two concrete selection leads:

- **E2 RESULT (2026-05-30): the age gate is a robust cross-venue refinement.** Testing an
  exhaustion-quality gate,
  the winner is **`pit-age-days-min=300` (drop symbols younger than 300 days)**: daily-DD MAR
  **bybit +2.93→+5.96, binance +0.25→+2.81** (return up, DD down on both), all-thirds-positive
  both venues, LOO-stable, bootstrap P(Δ>0) 83%/93%. It **improves the recent weak third on
  both venues** (bybit −2%→+25%, binance −26%→+4%) — refuting the age→early-regime confound and
  **explaining the recent edge-decay** (young-name shorts are systematic net losers — fresh
  listings squeeze; the signal works on seasoned names; verified cross-venue on the ledgers).
  `prior30-max-return-max=0.14` is a secondary cross-venue risk-reducer (halves DD).
  `universe-rank-max=110` (liquidity-tighten) was **rejected** — it hurt both venues (the
  `liquidity_rank` IC was a within-realized artifact the backtest caught). Note: OI / taker /
  funding features were **excluded** — they are NaN on `binance_full_pit`, so the earlier
  exploratory IC's binance derivative-feature cluster was an artifact. **Tier-2 demo-candidate,
  in-sample** — forward demo is the arbiter; deployment/profile change is the operator's call.
- **E2b confirmed the age effect is not a knife-edge**:
  dropping young names ~doubles MAR across age 200/300/400 on both venues, all-thirds-positive,
  recent-third improved both, LOO-stable, bootstrap P(Δ>0) 86–96% (binance age400 p5>0). bybit
  saturates ~age200 (≈MAR 6, flat to 400); binance monotone to 400. `age400` is the joint-best
  (bybit 6.91 / binance 5.64, ample trades); `age300` conservative; `prior30+age` an optional
  DD-reducer (mild bybit fragility). `age-alone` is the primary robust refinement.
- **E2c — the age gate is COST-ROBUST**:
  at 3× cost (45 bps) the baseline degrades (binance baseline goes **negative**, −4.7% / MAR −0.14),
  but the age-gated book stays strongly positive both venues (bybit age300 +71% / MAR 4.04; binance
  age300 +22% / MAR 1.74; age400 stronger). The gate removes losing trades → lower cost drag → the
  edge widens at higher cost. So the discrete age gate is robust to threshold (E2b), regime (E2),
  and cost (E2c) — a thoroughly-validated in-sample Tier-2 demo-candidate. Forward demo is the next gate.
- **E2d — the age gate is FILL-ROBUST + closes the loop on the original null**:
  under worst-case `bar_extreme` wick fills the baseline goes **negative on binance** (−6.8%/MAR −0.18)
  but the age-gated book stays strongly positive (bybit age300 +67%/MAR 3.85; binance age300 +27%/MAR 2.00).
  The original Round-2 "documented null" was worst-case fills + over-concentration on a universe that
  **included young names** (wildest wicks); the age gate (drop them) is the **structural remedy** — it
  makes the strategy survive even the brutal fill assumption. **In-sample validation is now exhaustive:
  threshold (E2b) + regime (E2) + cost (E2c) + stop-fill (E2d).** Forward demo (Tier-3, operator-gated)
  is the only remaining gate.
- **P2-1 (the sobering one): the edge is mostly FACTOR EXPOSURE, not unique alpha**.
  Decomposing the ledgers through the validated 6-factor risk model: the **baseline is pure factor
  exposure** (annualized residual Sharpe strongly *negative* under the robust common-4-factor model
  both venues — its raw Sharpe ≈1.1 is entirely priced premia from shorting high-vol/low-liquidity
  alts). The **age gate sharply reduces factor dependence** (residual jumps massively vs baseline),
  but the age-gated **residual alpha is borderline and not a clean cross-venue Tier-3 pass**: binance
  clears (+0.43–0.52) but bybit is marginal/model-sensitive (+0.27 full6 / −0.12 common4), and the
  √(trades/yr) annualization is optimistic (overlapping trades). So the strategy — even age-gated —
  is primarily a **factor-harvesting vehicle** (still a legitimate demo-candidate at MAR 3–6 / halved
  DD), but the "we found unique alpha" framing is **not** supported by the residual-Sharpe gate.
- **P2-2/3 (residual leaderboard) — the age gate's real value is FACTOR-NEUTRALIZATION**.
  Decomposing every candidate selection config: **no config clears Tier-3 residual ≥+0.3 cross-venue**
  (age residuals sign-flip bybit −/binance +). The biggest *return* lever `drop_all_4` (+295%) is
  **NOT alpha** — negative residual both venues = pure factor harvesting. But under *every* model the
  age gate moves the residual sharply up from the baseline's *inefficient factor bet* (−0.99/−0.42
  common4) toward **factor-neutral** (age400 −0.04/+0.26); **stricter age = more neutral**. So the age
  gate's robust contribution is **stripping factor exposure** (valuable for forward robustness — a
  near-neutral book resists factor-premium decay/crowding), not adding idiosyncratic alpha. Forward-demo
  the age gate as a **robust factor-neutralized short**, not a unique-alpha engine.
- **P3 — residual-momentum selection: a real refinement + a promising (uncertified) alpha lead**.
  Trailing factor-residual momentum (PIT, signal-close `lag1`) **strongly predicts which age300
  candidates are the best shorts, cross-venue** (IC −0.19 bybit / −0.35 binance — short the
  idiosyncratically-weak names), survives the strict-PIT lag, full coverage, holds recent. Selecting
  the low-rmom half lifts the per-trade residual Sharpe above the Tier-3 gate on both venues
  (+0.47/+1.25). **Caveat (honest):** `IC(rmom,residual)` is weak (−0.08/−0.03) while `IC(rmom,net)`
  is strong, so rmom predicts net mostly *through factor exposure*. Under **honest overlap-aware
  (weekly) annualization** (P3-3) the selected-subset residual Sharpe is **+0.28 bybit (marginal miss)
  / +1.14 binance (clear pass)** — i.e. **borderline Tier-3, not a clean cross-venue pass** — but the
  relative separation (selected vs discarded) is large/robust both venues and **very strong recently**
  (+1.9/+2.0). It's the program's **best alpha evidence**, sitting right at the Tier-3 threshold;
  certifying it needs an engine-integrated backtest (rmom as a PIT selection filter, overlap-aware
  annualization) — **operator-gated build** (the precheck justifies it).
- **P3b (BUILT + VALIDATED, operator-greenlit): the residual-momentum gate is a robust Tier-2
  DEMO-CANDIDATE**.
  Integrated the signal as a PIT selection filter in the engine (commit 17df8ba; default-inactive,
  tested, 1054 tests pass) and backtested it (gate at the per-venue median rmom, both venues, 15 bps):
  **return 2–3×, Sharpe doubled, DD halved** (bybit +98%→+210% / Sh 1.59→3.81 / DD −16%→−3.3%; binance
  +32%→+90% / Sh 0.96→2.93 / DD −11%→−4%), all-thirds-positive both, LOO-stable, bootstrap MAR-Δ p5≫0
  → **r1_robustness DEMO-ELIGIBLE** (the program's strongest, most robust Tier-2 result). Tier-3 residual
  (overlap-aware weekly): the gate factor-neutralizes both venues; **binance clears +0.3 (+1.10) = genuine
  factor-neutral alpha, but bybit is residual-neutral full-window (+0.00, +2.18 recent)** → NOT a clean
  cross-venue alpha certification. So the gate = **risk-reduction + factor-neutralization + venue-asymmetric/
  recent residual alpha** — a validated demo-candidate, not a fully-certified all-weather alpha engine.
  (MARs DD-inflated; robust diagnostics + residual Sharpe are the headline.) **Recommend forward-demoing it**
  (operator-gated profile change; the forward demo is the real Tier-3 arbiter for OOS persistence).
- **The continuous candidate signal (c2b, 2026-05-30, EXPLORATORY) — age gate flips it on the
  full window but the edge is RECENT-REGIME-ONLY.** The rolling features carry real cross-venue IC
  (`rv_168h` −0.13 @168h). c2's decile short was "not tradeable" because the top-composite decile
  *rallies* in the full panel (young-name M1 continuation). Applying `age≥300` flips the full-window
  average to cost-positive @168h (short-only +29/+35 bps; beta-neutral L/S +14/+22). **But the
  recent/early split refutes the robust reading**: even the beta-neutral L/S is **negative in the
  early 26 months** (−14/−12 bps) and positive only in the recent ~12 (2025–26 alt-bear, largely
  short-beta). So the continuous age-gated short is **regime-conditional, not all-weather** → the
  C0 build is **not justified** on this (contrast the discrete strategy, all-thirds-positive incl.
  early). Honest null for the strong "rescues the continuous architecture" claim.

**Cross-venue asymmetry — REFRAMED by CV1 (2026-05-30):** the headline gap (bybit MAR 2.76
vs binance 0.28) is **NOT an edge-quality asymmetry** — the per-trade edge is venue-general
(matched-event corr 0.89, binance ≈ bybit on shared coins). It is **breadth + universe
composition**: binance fires ~half the events and its venue-unique coins are weak marginals
(see the CV1 section). binance is funding-missing (optimistic). The recent per-trade mean
decay on BOTH venues (tail-driven) is **squeeze-driven and is fixed by the rmom gate** — see
the RD1 section (cuts ~75% of recent stop-outs; restores recent mean both venues).

## K0→K1a (2026-05-30): the intraday-detection kernel — ceiling PASS, but FALSIFIED at K1a

The forward plan ([research_plan_intraday_kernel.md](research_plan_intraday_kernel.md))
asks whether detecting the discrete event **intraday** (off the WS stream) instead of on
the daily-close roll captures more of the fade. **K0** is the read-only upside-ceiling
precheck (`scripts/k0_intraday_fade_timing_precheck.py`, EXPLORATORY): for every short in
the validated daily ledger, compare the realized +1h entry to the **event-day intraday
high** — the best price a faster detector could have shorted at.

**Result: PASS, decisively, both venues × both early/recent splits × two books**
(primary `fixed_delay`/age≥90 to isolate detection latency; secondary age≥300
`quality_squeeze`). Median `ceiling_uplift` **bybit ~993–1041 bps, binance ~862–881 bps**
(~8–11%), positive in every split (bybit EARLY 957–1026 / RECENT 1000–1071; binance EARLY
698–778 / RECENT 969–996) — clears the ~15 bps cost gate by ~50–65×. The missed edge is
**0.84–1.41× the entire realized fade.** So the daily-close (+1h) entry is **systematically
~8–11% late** vs the intraday peak, all-weather (not a recent-regime artifact — passes the
c2b guard).

**Decomposition (K0b, `scripts/k0b_fade_decomposition.py`):** ~**95–98% of the ceiling is
the within-day-D giveback** (peak→daily-close); the +1h overnight fill window is only
~19–64 bps (~2–6%). → the lever is **intraday DETECTION**, not faster fills (re-confirms E1
at the daily→intraday scale). **Caveat:** it's an optimistic *ceiling* (assumes shorting the
exact top, which is unknowable in real time and pre-event-confirmation) → **necessary, not
sufficient.** The realistic capture is a fraction of it, measured next in K1a.

**K1a (2026-05-30) — FALSIFIED: the ceiling is un-capturable; the kernel is dead.** The cheap
feasibility check (`scripts/k1a_intraday_first_crossing.py`, conditioned on daily-firers, the
*optimistic* test) found the first intraday hour the **same selector** fires and the realistic
uplift (fill at `h*`+1 vs the daily +1h entry): only **~40–85 bps median (~10–15% of the
ceiling)**, a **coin flip** (45–46% of trades negative, q25 ≈ −3% / q75 ≈ +5%), **negative on
binance early**, `corr(lead,uplift)≈0`. **Mechanism:** the selector can't *confirm* the event
(cumulative turnover ≥6×) until median `h*` = 15–16:00 UTC — ~9h after the morning peak — by
which point price has faded back to ≈ the daily entry; confirmation time (turnover
accumulation) is **decoupled from the price path**. So the ~9% ceiling is real but
un-capturable by faster detection of the *same* event. **This closes the timing axis:** E1
killed *fill* timing (within 1h); K1a kills *detection* timing (~9h, same selector). The alpha
is **purely SELECTION**, the daily cadence is fine, and **K1b/K2 are cancelled** — the program
reverts to the validated selection refinements (age gate + residual-momentum gate, forward-demo
-gated). A *new* intraday-native selector is a separate unchartered direction. Receipts:
`docs/preregistration/k0-intraday-fade-timing-2026-05-30.md` (ceiling),
`k1-intraday-detection-2026-05-30.md` (K1a falsifier).

**I-phase (2026-05-30, operator-directed REOPENING — K1a was too narrow).** K1a only
falsified running the *daily selector* hourly (its ≥6×-**daily**-turnover rule can't confirm
until ~15:00, after the fade). It did NOT test a **purpose-built intraday selector** firing on
*rate/flow* features at the peak — a genuinely different signal. Reopened to engineer one.
Data verified (correcting a wrong memory): cross-venue all-weather channels = klines
(price/volume/intrabar/velocity) + **premium_index (hourly) + funding (8h)** both venues +
market-context; **OI bybit-only**; taker-flow binance-recent-only (out). 1h grain.
**I1a (`scripts/i1a_fader_intraday_signature.py`):** faders show a clear cross-venue intraday
**exhaustion fingerprint** — peak ~16–17:00 UTC, peak-bar **upper-wick ~0.43** + mid-range
close (intrabar rejection), **turnover climax ~4.2–4.6× the day-mean at the peak** then rolloff,
price +20–22% then fades ~6–8% over 6h; **OI builds into + surges after the peak on bybit**
(+28%→+54%); premium ~0 (froth channel quiet). So the fingerprint EXISTS (necessary). **The
make-or-break is I1b:** do pumps that CONTINUE (don't fade) show the same fingerprint at their
intraday burst? If a PIT-causal feature separates faders from continuers → build the selector;
if not → honest null (this time of the *right* hypothesis). "Timing is dead" is therefore
**downgraded to: the same-selector intraday variant is dead; the purpose-built intraday selector
is UNDER ACTIVE INVESTIGATION.**

**I1b RESULT (2026-05-30) — separation CONFIRMED, beta-neutral, cross-venue, all-weather → build I2.**
Scanned ALL intraday rate-bursts (age≥300, liq-rank 31–400, intraday gain ≥8% + hourly vol-spike
≥5× the prior-7d avg hour, cooldown 3d, forward 48h) across BOTH venues — including pumps that
never became daily events (bybit 8968, binance 7912 bursts; `scripts/i1b_burst_separation.py`).
Tested which PIT-causal features separate faders from continuers, then **beta-neutralized**
(coin forward return − market forward return):
- **The separation SURVIVES beta-neutralization** (so it's idiosyncratic, NOT the rejected
  market-regime beta bet): `idio` (pump magnitude relative to market) ic_neutral **−0.28…−0.31**;
  velocity / vol-spike / acceleration **−0.11…−0.16**; on **BOTH venues × BOTH early/recent**. The
  intrabar **wick is noise** (ic≈0) — the I1a fingerprint's wick does NOT discriminate fade vs continue.
- **It's a SELECTION on pump-extremity, not "short every pump":** shorting ALL bursts is
  ~breakeven-to-negative beta-neutral (mean −0.6…−0.9% early); the **extreme subset** (top
  idio/velocity quintile) has beta-neutral short-PnL **+1.2–1.3% early / +4.4–4.7% recent** (gross 48h).
- **Mechanism (reconciles RD1):** the intraday burst entry catches the idiosyncratic short-term
  reversal of extreme pumps that the daily entry (next-day +1h) is too late for — by the daily close
  the faders have faded and only continuers remain (RD1's squeezes). So intraday detection DOES add
  value — but as a **NEW extreme-pump-reversal selector**, not the daily selector run sooner.
- **Verdict: the make-or-break PASSES.** Next = **I2**: backtest the extreme-pump-burst short under
  the realistic engine (15 & 45 bps, capped stops, max_active, both venues, early/recent, MAR-primary)
  AND residualize through `risk_model` (is it unique alpha vs the known short-term-reversal factor?).
  **Honest bounds:** gross-forward edge must survive costs+stops; the edge is in the extreme subset;
  it is plausibly short-term-reversal concentrated by the liquidity-migration framing — I2 settles it.

**I2 RESULT (2026-05-30, `scripts/i2_burst_backtest.py`) — signal REAL, naïve stopped strategy FAILS.**
Backtested the frozen extreme-burst short (12% stop, 48h max-hold, costs, +1h fill), both venues,
early/recent. **Without a stop** the extreme subset is net-positive at 15 bps — bybit +1.79% (E +0.74 /
R +3.47), binance +1.74% (E +1.10 / R +2.90) per trade — positive **both venues × both eras**, beating
all-bursts (~+0.4%): the I1b signal is **real, not an artifact**. **But with a realistic 12% stop it
collapses:** ~breakeven at 15 bps (bybit −0.01% / binance +0.05% ALL) and **negative at 45 bps**;
**33–41% of trades stop out** (−14% each), eating the edge; portfolio MAR ~0/negative, recent-skewed.
**Mechanism:** the median trade is +2.3%/wins 55%, but pump-shorts wiggle up ≥12% before fading often
enough that any risk-bounding stop is hit ~40% of the time. No-stop is positive but **undeployable**
(unbounded short tail risk). **This rediscovers WHY the strategy shorts the confirmed FADE, not the top
(E1)** — the burst-short is "catch the top." **Verdict: not a deployable edge as a naïve top-short.**
**Next = I2b:** apply fade-confirm execution intraday — use the burst to flag the candidate, short the
intraday **giveback**, not the burst — to dodge the continuation that causes the stop-outs. Receipt:
`docs/preregistration/i2-intraday-burst-selector-2026-05-30.md`.

**I2b + stop-width resolution (2026-05-30) — the WIDE STOP monetizes it → a real (unvalidated) lead.**
I2b (short the intraday *giveback*, not the burst) did NOT rescue it — confirm-rate ≈1.0 (almost every
pump gives back 3–8% within 48h, so it barely filters) and it stayed recent-only / early-negative both
venues. Wrong fix. The RIGHT lever is **stop WIDTH**: the daily strategy's **12% stop is far too tight**
for a catch-the-top short (38% stop-out). Stop-width frontier (EXTREME subset, both venues, per-trade
net45 + Stage-B-proxy portfolio MAR/DD):
- 12% → MAR −0.8 (fails, recent-only); 20% → ~1.45; **30% → MAR 3.2/2.79, DD 14.5/10.7%, ALL-WEATHER
  (EARLY net45 +0.15/+0.25 both venues)**; 50% → MAR 4.88/8.01, DD 16/9% (better, EARLY +0.44/+0.64);
  no-stop → best raw return but the **tail blows out** (DD 26/20%, a −20% squeeze-day).
- **Monotonic 12%→50% (not a fragile sweet-spot):** the tight stop killed a real edge; a wide (30–50%)
  stop captures it with **bounded** tail (worst-day ~−4%); only removing the stop entirely exposes the
  −20% day. So the 12% mismatch was the problem — the signal IS monetizable.

**Verdict: a REAL, promising, cross-venue, all-weather intraday lead** — the extreme-pump-burst short +
a wide (30–50%) stop, MAR ~3–8 / DD 9–16% net of 15–45 bps, both venues, both eras. **NOT validated:**
(a) **Stage-B PROXY** (entry-day P&L booking, approximate concurrency → needs an engine-grade backtest);
(b) **wide-stop FILL realism is the key risk** — a 30–50% stop can gap far worse in a squeeze (the 2% slip
is optimistic); (c) **funding UNMODELED** (plausibly a *credit* here — shorts receive funding during
pump-long-crowding — or a drag); (d) back-loaded / thin early; (e) **STR-factor uniqueness open** (is this
the known short-term-reversal factor?). **Next = I3 (pre-registered):** engine-grade backtest (true
exit-timing/concurrency + capped fills + funding) + `risk_model` residual + STR-factor test;
operator-gated. A lead worth building properly — **not** a deployable strategy yet. Receipt:

## CV1 (2026-05-30): the cross-venue asymmetry is BREADTH + composition, NOT edge-quality

Read-only decomposition of the age-gated ledgers both venues
(`scripts/cv1_cross_venue_decomposition.py`, EXPLORATORY). The standing "Bybit strong /
Binance weak" caveat is substantially a **misframe**:
- **The per-trade edge is venue-GENERAL.** On the 164 events that fire on the *same coin,
  same day* on both venues, outcomes correlate **0.89** and Binance is marginally *better*
  (matched median net +0.52% vs +0.40%, paired diff ≈ 0). Per-venue per-trade net is
  near-identical (bybit median +0.34% / win 63%; binance +0.27% / win 61%). The edge is
  **not** Bybit-specific.
- **The aggregate gap (age-gated sum +72% vs +29%) is BREADTH + composition.** Bybit fires
  ~1.9× more events (579 vs 307; 270 vs 182 symbols) — Binance USD-M has fewer mid-liquidity
  alt perps in the rank-31–400 band. And Binance's **venue-unique** coins (on Binance, not
  Bybit) are weak marginal shorts (mean **−0.05%**, sum −7.4%, win 57%) — less liquid (rank
  ~92 vs 69), weaker spike (turnover ~9× vs 14×), worst recently — whereas Bybit's
  venue-unique coins are fine (+0.30% median, +45% sum).
- **No clean single-feature filter removes the weak coins.** Per-trade net vs turnover-ratio
  is weak/non-monotone (corr +0.08 bybit / +0.04 binance; venue-best buckets differ), and
  rank-tightening was already rejected (E2). The weak binance-only coins can't be filtered
  without dropping good events.

**Implication:** the edge is **robust and replicates cross-venue on shared (high-quality)
events** — reassuring for the real-money robustness question; Binance is **breadth-limited**
(fewer/lower-quality unique events), not edge-weak. The MAR 2.76-vs-0.28 gap is the
aggregate-return + drawdown denominator driven by breadth, not a weaker signal. (The recent
per-trade mean decay is real on **both** venues — tail-driven — and remains the genuine
standing caveat.) JSON: `~/SHARED_DATA/cv1_cross_venue_2026-05-30.json`.

## RD1 (2026-05-30): the recent decay is SQUEEZE-driven — and the rmom gate fixes it

Following CV1's one genuine caveat (recent per-trade MEAN decay, both venues, tail-driven),
RD1 dissects the recent (≥2025-06-01) tail of the age-gated book
(`scripts/rd1_recent_decay_rmom.py`, EXPLORATORY):
- **Mechanism — idiosyncratic strength vs a weak market.** Recent losers are overwhelmingly
  **stop-outs** (bybit 81, binance 57 of recent losers) and cluster on days the **broad market
  is DOWN** (losers: `market_pct_up_1d` ~0.28–0.32, `market_median_return_1d`<0, BTC down;
  winners: `market_pct_up` ~0.44–0.47). A coin pumping *against* a weak market has **genuine
  idiosyncratic strength** and keeps running → squeezes the short. (Counterintuitively the short
  works BEST when the event rides a broad up-market that mean-reverts — the *opposite* of "don't
  short a rally"; a `market_pct_up` ceiling would remove the winners, not the losers.)
- **Fix — the residual-momentum gate (P3b) removes exactly these names.** rmom shorts
  idiosyncratically-WEAK candidates, filtering the strong-against-weak-market squeeze coins.
  Recent tail, age-gated baseline → rmom-gated: **stop-out losers cut ~75%** (bybit 81→19,
  binance 57→14), worst-decile drag halved, recent per-trade **mean ~5–17×** (bybit
  +0.08%→+0.39%, binance +0.02%→+0.35%), recent **sum** bybit +22.6%→+71.0% / binance
  +4.2%→+42.1%, **both venues.** Selective (median rises too; not just fewer trades).

**So** the recent decay (the standing caveat) is **squeeze-driven**, and the already-validated,
PIT-clean **rmom gate is the mechanistic fix** — it removes the idiosyncratic-strength squeezes
the age-gated book still takes. This both **explains WHY the rmom gate works** (it is a squeeze
filter, not just "return 2–3×") and **strengthens the case to forward-demo it** (it addresses the
very thing — recent decay — that most threatens a forward demo). Profile change is operator-gated.

## Useful findings worth keeping

1. **Concentration is the deployed config's main risk.** `max_active` 3→12 cuts worst-day
   −36%→−4.8% and DD −87%→−27.5%. The demo runs 3; research-validated is 12. **Move it.**
2. **Stop-fill assumption** dominated the old verdict: `bar_extreme` (worst-case wick) vs a
   10% cap swung the deployed curve −32% → +479% (concentration-amplified). Default is now
   `bar_extreme_capped` 10% (realistic bad-case), calibratable from demo fills.
3. **Component winners** (daily): `risk_equal` 2% sizing (de-concentrates, cuts DD),
   `ff6_4pct` failed-fade exit (best loss-cutter), `drop_all_4` filter set.
4. **Pre-2023 is structurally untradeable** (bybit had 7–182 symbols; rank-31–400 + ≥150
   rank-climb needs the 400+ universe that only existed from ~mid-2024). There is **no
   internal OOS root** — pristine OOS is the forward demo (see [data_roots.md](data_roots.md)).
5. **Long sleeve = a low-correlation OVERLAY on the short book, not standalone alpha.**
   The v11a long (FC) sleeve's FC signal is the quality ceiling (exhaustive 7-wave search
   couldn't beat it on both venues; [[long-sleeve-alpha-search-null]]). Its value is
   diversification: short↔long correlation ≈ −0.02/−0.05 (Bybit/Binance), so an additive
   overlay (`combined = short + w·long`, w ≈ 0.5–1.0) lifts the combined book's risk-adjusted
   return — cross-venue **MAR +17% (Bybit) / +38% (Binance)** at w=1.0, drawdown flat-to-better,
   paying off precisely on the short book's worst days. The robust part is the
   variance-reduction (structural regime complementarity); the standalone-return *magnitudes*
   are 2023–2026 in-sample-optimistic (FC fails pre-2023 OOS), so don't over-size (w≥2 just
   bets the fragile long edge). Already deployed on demo; forward demo is the OOS arbiter.

## Methodology lessons

Engine hardening (2026-05-29) toward honesty was correct in direction: optimistic→honest
stop fills, 100% taker, calendar-exact returns, real promotion gates, full-PIT survivorship.
**The over-correction** was making worst-case `bar_extreme` the *default* (too brutal on 1h
alt wicks — real stop slip median +2.3%, but it assumed wick-tops to +89%). Fixed to a 10%
cap. **The deeper lesson:** never test a strategy with a single hard-coded execution; the
selection signal and the entry signal must be evaluated separately, or you measure the
execution's flaws and blame the signal.

## Was "Round 2 = null" right?

**No.** It was a worst-case execution model *and* a selection/execution conflation. The
daily strategy (with fade-confirmation execution) is positive on both venues in-sample. The
continuous selection signal is real and never got an execution layer. **The strategy is not
dead.** Open work: (a) move the demo to `max_active=12` + capped fills; (b) the
`fixed_delay` vs `quality_squeeze` test to quantify the execution signal's contribution;
(c) apply + refine the execution (sniper) on the continuous candidate pool; (d) forward-demo
confirmation is the arbiter. Any of these is a fresh, dated pre-registration.
