"""The Bybit orderbook sequence contract, on the fixture the live feed reads too.

`tests/fixtures/bybit_orderbook_sequence.jsonl` is one raw venue message per
line with the verdict both sides must reach: `apply`, `rebase`, `gap`,
`before_snapshot`. The Rust feed drives the same file through `FeedState` in
`engine/engine-marketdata/src/bybit/state.rs`.
